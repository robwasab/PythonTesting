This directory contains python code to test the 'reading 12-bit accelerometer C program' 
located in ../C_files

The test program relies on bitstring, a third party library to generate the binary files
that are to be inputed into the C executable. 

run the below command to install the library.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Notes about the program:
test.py saves test.bin to ../Input

The C files in ../C_files are compiled and the executable is run like so:
$ ../C_files/main ../Input/test.bin

All output is stored in ../Output
The executable's output is compared with the output generated by test.py with diff
if there are any differences, they are printed and the program stops.
